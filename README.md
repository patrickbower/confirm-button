# DAZN Prototype Template v2.0

Use this boilerplate as a template for prototype development.

## Commands

Standard CRA `npm` and `yarn` commands available (using `craco` rather than `react-scripts` to enable Tailwind post css processing and purging).

```bash
$yarn start
$yarn build
```

To create password protected builds use the following command.

```bash
$yarn build-encrypted
```

> Note: Password is hard coded inline of `build-encrypted` command within `package.json` file
